Used packages:

- sass
- @mui/material
- @mui/icons-material
- @mui/system
- react-select; react-select-async-paginate, react-card-flip
- react-tsparticles (@1.42.1, important!)

SunsetTime, sunriseTime and timezone were managed by a Reducer in a Context, for these would have require prop drilling otherwise, and were not part of any conditional rendering.
